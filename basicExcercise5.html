      Forrest Gump is a 1994 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Robert
      Zemeckis and written by Eric Roth. It is based on the 1986 novel of the same
      name by Winston Groom and stars <mark>Tom Hanks</mark>, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti
      Williamson and Sally Field. The story depicts several decades in the life of
      Forrest Gump (Hanks), a slow-witted but kind-hearted man from Alabama who
      witnesses and unwittingly influences several defining historical events in the
      20th century United States. The film differs substantially from the novel.</p>

      <p> <em>
        Principal photography took place between August and December 1993, mainly in
        Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Extensive visual effects were used
        to incorporate Hanks into archived footage and to develop other scenes. The
        soundtrack features songs reflecting the different periods seen in the film.

      <p>  Forrest Gump was released in the United States on July 6, 1994 and received
      praise for Zemeckis's direction, performances, visual effects, music, and
      screenplay. The film was an enormous success at the box office; it became the
      top-grossing film in America released that year and earned over US$677 million
      worldwide during its theatrical run, making it the second highest-grossing film
      of 1994, behind The Lion King. The soundtrack sold over 12 million copies.
      Forrest Gump won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor
      for Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing.
      It received many award nominations, including Golden Globes, British Academy
      Film Awards and Screen Actors Guild Awards.</p>

      <p> Varying interpretations have been made of the protagonist and the film's
        political symbolism. In 2011, the Library of Congress selected the film for
        preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being "culturally,
        historically, or aesthetically significant".<sub>[3][4][5]</sub></p>
